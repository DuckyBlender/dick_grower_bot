# 🍆 Dick Grower Bot

The Discord bot that answers the age-old question: **Does size matter?** (Spoiler: Yes, it does.)

## What Is This?

A Discord bot that lets users grow their virtual... ahem... "cucumber". Compete with friends to see who can achieve the most impressive length!

## Features

- 📏 Grow your digital dong (/grow)
- 📊 Climb your server's leaderboard (/top)
- 🌎 See how you measure up globally (/global)
- 🥊 Challenge others to dick battles (/pvp)
- 🏆 Random "Dick of the Day" awards (/dickoftheday)
- 📈 Detailed growth statistics (/stats)

## How It Works

Every 1 hour, users can use the `/grow` command for a chance to increase (or occasionally decrease) their length. Growth is measured in centimeters, and ranges from -5 to +10 cm per day (80% change to grow).

`/dickoftheday` also gives 10-25 cm to a random active user once per day.

New users get a grace period of guaranteed positive growth to help them get started!
